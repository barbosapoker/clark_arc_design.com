    <p class="p2">The architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and
    Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Indian and Chinese architecture have had great influence on
    the surrounding regions, while Japanese architecture has not. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great
    regional diversity. Hindu temple architecture, which developed from around the 5th century CE, is in theory governed
    by concepts laid down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm. In many
    Asian countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the
    natural landscape.

    In many parts of Asia, even the grandest houses were relatively lightweight structures mainly using wood until
    recent times, and there are few survivals of great age. Buddhism was associated with a move to stone and brick
    religious structures, probably beginning as rock-cut architecture, which has often survived very well.

    Early Asian writings on architecture include the Kao Gong Ji of China from the 7thâ€“5th centuries BCE; the Shilpa
    Shastras of ancient India; Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra of Sri Lanka and Araniko of Nepal
